Basically MONARC is composed of two main parts:

* a back office: for the management of entities, users and the front office
  instances;
* a front office: for the management of your risks analysis.


====
TODO: Add a simple schema about the complete architecture (with the 3 servers,
reverse proxy, etc.)
====

A front office instance can be used without the back office.

It is possible to connect many front offices to one back office.
