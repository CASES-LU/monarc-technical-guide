Basically MONARC is composed of two main parts:

* a back office: for the management of entities;
* a front office: for the management of the risks analysis. A front office
  instance can be used without the back office.

The whole architecture includes an additional reverse proxy and a configuration
server. It is possible to connect many front offices to one back office.
