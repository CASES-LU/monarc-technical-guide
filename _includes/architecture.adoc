Basically MONARC is composed of two main parts:

* a back office: for the management of the database, servers and clients of
  MONARC installation;
* a front office: for the management of the risks analysis. A front office
  instance can be used without the back office.

The whole architecture includes an additional reverse proxy and a configuration
server. It is possible to connect many front offices to one back office.

* The configuration server manages the configurations of the back office,
  reverse proxy and different front office(s) through SSH.
* The database _common_ of the BO should also be available to the FO servers.


[NOTE]
====
If you want run your own risk analysis you only need the front office.
