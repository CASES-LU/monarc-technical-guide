=== Modules of the project

The source code of MONARC is divided in several modules with dedicated Git
repositories.

=== Global architecture

Basically MONARC is composed of two main parts:

* a back office: for the management of the security models, FO servers and
  clients of MONARC installations;
* a front office: for the management of the risks analysis. A front office
  instance can be used without the back office.

[NOTE]
====
If you want run your own risk analysis you only need the front office.
More information about the installation in
<<_includes/deployment.adoc#monarc,this section>>.
====

The whole architecture includes an additional reverse proxy (**RPX**) and a
configuration server (**CFG**). It is possible to connect many front offices
(**FO**) to one back office (**BO**).
The deployment is managed with link:https://www.ansible.com[ansible].
More information in the repository of the
link:https://github.com/monarc-project/ansible-ubuntu[ansible playbook].

[[monarc-architecture-schema]]

link:https://github.com/CASES-LU/MOSP[MOSP] is a platform to create, edit
and share JSON objects.
The goal is to gather security related JSON objects, in the first place aimed
to be used with link:https://github.com/monarc-project/MonarcAppFO[MONARC].
You can use any available schemas in order to create new JSON objects.
You can have a look at link:https://objects.monarc.lu[official instance] operated
by link:https://github.com/CASES-LU[CASES]. MONARC instances can directly query
MOSP in order to update their knowledge base. You can have a look at the
link:https://www.monarc.lu/documentation/MOSP-documentation/[documentation of MOSP].

link:https://github.com/monarc-project/stats-service[Stats Service] is an API
for the collection and processing of stats data from different MONARC instances. 

.Example of IPs and FQDNs:
[NOTE]
====
* 172.18.14.73 - monarc-rpx.private.your.domain.com - my.monarc.lu
* 172.18.13.71 - monarc-conf.private.your.domain.com
* 172.18.13.72 - monarc-master.private.your.domain.com
* 172.18.13.73 - monarc-fo01.private.your.domain.com
* 172.18.13.74 - monarc-fo02.private.your.domain.com
====

In this example, the **FO** server _monarc-fo01_ hosts two distinct databases
for two clients. An Apache Virtual Host is also configured for each clients. A
user who wants to do a security analysis with MONARC will access to his MONARC
account via the address https://my.monarc.lu/formation/

Note that the _common_ database of the **BO** is listening on ``0.0.0.0:3306``.


[[TLS-certificate]]
It is strongly recommended to use a TLS certificate on the reverse proxy in
order to provide a HTTPS connection between Internet and the reverse proxy. In
our example, a TLS certificate for my.monarc.lu is used.


=== Network requirements

The configuration server (**CFG**) manages the configurations of the back
office, reverse proxy and different front office(s) via SSH.

The reverse proxy (**RPX**) should of course be available from Internet. The
**DNS** is important for the reverse proxy in order to resolve the FQDNs of the
servers inside the network.

Through the reverse proxy you should be able to contact the **BO** and the
**FO**s from Internet. No need to able able to contact the configuration server
from the outside.

The database _common_ of the BO should also be available to the FO servers.

link:http://www.postfix.org[Postfix] should be installed on the BO and on the
FO. Indeed, SMTP is used for the account creation and the password recovery.
The easiest configuration is to set up Postfix for relaying emails through your
internal mail server (**SMTP**).
