=== Global architecture

Basically MONARC is composed of two main parts:

* a back office: for the management of the database, servers and clients of
  MONARC installation;
* a front office: for the management of the risks analysis. A front office
  instance can be used without the back office.

[NOTE]
====
If you want run your own risk analysis you only need the front office.
More information about the installation in
<<_includes/deployment.adoc#only-the-front-office,this section>>.
====

The whole architecture includes an additional reverse proxy and a configuration
server. It is possible to connect many front offices to one back office.

* The configuration server manages the configurations of the back office,
  reverse proxy and different front office(s) via SSH (on the same network
  or through a VPN).
* The reverse proxy should of course be available from Internet.
* The database _common_ of the BO should also be available to the FO servers.
