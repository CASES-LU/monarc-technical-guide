Basically MONARC is composed of two main parts:

* a back office: for the management of entities;
* a front office: for the management of the risks analysis. A front office
  instance can be used without the back office.

The whole architecture includes an additional reverse proxy and a configuration
server. It is possible to connect many front offices to one back office.

The whole architecture can be deployed with

If you want to simply test MONARC or run your own risk analysis you probably
only need the front office. More information about the installation in 
<<_includes/deployment.adoc#only-the-front-office,this section>>.
