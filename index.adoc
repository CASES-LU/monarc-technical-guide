= Architecture

MONARC is composed of two main parts:

* a back office: for the management of entities and users;
* a front office.


// TODO: add a simple schema about the architecture


.Summary of the different modules of the project
[cols="h,a,a"]
|===
|| Back office | Front office

| NOTE: Creation of users and instances.
| NOTE: A front office instance can be used without the back office.

| Modules
| * MonarcCore ({uri-zm-core}[zm-core] in vendor/monarc/core)
  * MonarcBO ({uri-zm-backoffice}[zm-backoffice] in vendor/monarc/backoffice)
| * MonarcCore ({uri-zm-core}[zm-core] in vendor/monarc/core)
  * MonarcFO ({uri-zm-client}[zm-client] in vendor/monarc/frontoffice)

| Interfaces
| * {uri-ng-anr}[ng_anr]
  * {uri-ng-backoffice}[ng_backoffice]
| * {uri-ng-anr}[ng_anr]
  * {uri-ng-client}[ng_client]

It is possible to connect many front offices to one back office.
